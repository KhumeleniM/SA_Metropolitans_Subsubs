# Hotspots suburbs vs social activities in South Africa's eight (8) Metros for property investment
## Description & Disscusion of the Background
In south Africa, the constitution provides for three categories of municipalities. There are 278 municipalities in South Africa, comprising of eight metropolitans, 44 district and 226 local municipalities. They are focused on growing local economies and providing infrastructure and service. As a results, the metros contain the hottest cities and suburbs in South Africa with City of Johannesburg, City of Cape Town, City of Tshwane and eThekwini as the four biggest metros containing the hottest suburbs in SA. These metro host cities like Johannesburg, Cape Town, Pretoria and Durban respectively.

As a results we find most SA's residents flocking to these metros from their villages (rural areas) to uncover new treasures like, better education, job opportunities and etc. Eventually, most SA's residents end up residing permanently, buying properties and starting businesses in these cities and thus they become populated. When we think of it from a property investment point of view, we expect investor to buy in areas which are not too populated (for security/safety reasons) and the property value are reasonably low, in addition such area should also have a variety of social places nearby. However, it is not always easy to obtain information that will guide investors in this direction.

Given the problems we have in terms of finding people flocking to the cities to uncover new treasure, we can create a map and information chart where the property value is shown and each hottest suburbs within the eight metros is clustered according to the social venue density and similarities.

These informative maps are not readily available, they can assist people when deciding where to invest in property taking social activities and property values into considerations. They can also assist municipalities (metros in particular) to advance their social development by comparing themselves with the metros in terms of how they compare, where they can improve in order to attract more property investor

## Data Description

To consider the problem, we can list the data used and its sources as follow:

* The eight (8) metropolitan's average property value was obtain from the national property report, dated 3 March 2021. Then, this was merged with the hottest suburbs' average property prices within these metros in terms of property investment.
*	The average property values were retrieved from property24 and private-property websites.
*	Used google earth to obtain the central geographical coordinates of these suburbs in these metros
*	Foursquare API is used to get the most common venues nearby each of these suburbs up to a radius of 10km, using the central suburbs geographical coordinates obtained from Google maps search engine.

## Methodology
#### 3.1 Data pre-processing
#### 3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis by Suburbs
#### 3.3 Suburb's clustering using K-Means algorithm
#### 3.4 Housing prices analysis
#### 3.5 Visualization of results and creation of the informative maps
