# Hotspots suburbs vs social activities in South Africa's eight (8) Metros for property investment
## Description & Disscusion of the Background
In south Africa, the constitution provides for three categories of municipalities. There are 278 municipalites in South Africa, comprising of eight metropolitan, 44 district and 226 local municipalities. They are focused on growing local economies and providing infrastructure and service. As a results, the metros contain the hottest cities and suburbs in South Africa with City of Johannesburg, City of Cape Town, City of Tswane and eThekhwini as the four biggest metros containing the most hottest suburbs in SA. These metro host cities like Johannesburg, Cape Town, Pretoria and Durban respectively.

As a results we find most SA's residents flooding to these metros from their villages (rural areas) to sick better eductaion and job opportunities to name a few. Eventually, most SA's residents end up residing permanantely, buying properties and starting businesses in these cities and thus they become populated. When we think of it from a property investement point of view, we expect investor to buy in areas which are not too populated (for security/safety reasons) and the property value are reasonably low, in addition such area should also have a variety of social places nearby. However, it is not always easy to obtain information that will quide investors in this direction.

Taking all these problems in consideration, we can create a map and information chart where the property value is shown and each hottest subsurbs within the eight metros is clustered according to the social venue density and similarities.

## Data Description

To consider the problem we can list the data used and its sources as follow:

* The eigh metropolitan's average property value was obtain from the national property report, dated 3 March 2021. Then, this was merged with the hottest suburbs' average property prices within these metros in terms of property investment.
* The average property values were retrieved from property24 and privateproverty websites.
* I used **Google Maps** to obtain the centeral geographical coordinates of these subsurbs in these metros
* I used **Foursquare API** to get the most common venues nearby each of these subsurbs.
